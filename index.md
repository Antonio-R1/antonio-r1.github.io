### [Engine Sound Generator](https://github.com/Antonio-R1/engine-sound-generator)

### [Racing JS](https://github.com/Antonio-R1/racing-js)
A 3D browser game written in HTML5, JavaScript and WebGL in which the users can drive cars and airplanes. It uses the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/) libraries for the 3D graphics and physics, respectively. It is subdivided into three games: “Flight Over the Mountains”, “Island” and “Race”. The game “Flight Over the Mountains” uses its own small physics engine. The game “Race” is a multiplayer game that is not finished yet and will be added to the repository later.
