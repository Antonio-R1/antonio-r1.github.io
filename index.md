#### [Racing JS](https://github.com/Antonio-R1/racing-js)
A 3D browser game in which the users can drive cars and airplanes. It is written in HTML5, Javascript and WebGL. It uses the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/) libraries for the 3D graphics and physics, respectively.
It is subdivided in three games: "Flight Over the Mountains", "Island" and "Race".
The game "Flight Over the Mountains" uses its own small physics engine. The game "Race" is a multiplayer game which is not finished yet
and will be added to the repository later.
